Nothing's guaranteed.**

##Dependencies
* A Brain
* A GNU based distro
* A Shell (not a sea one, more something like Bourne's one)
* Node.js
* Coffeescript
* Node-inspector
* Haml (only SASS in facts…¬¬ )

##Quick start
    $ cd my/project/diretory
    $ ./make.sh
    $ ./run.sh
→ http://localhost:3000

*If you don't understand the previous lines, don't try to run this project for now. Go back to a normal life, turn "ON" your SNES and enjoy a real good game that can run.*

##Descriptions
###For humans
This is supposed to become a game, "Squaresoft's golden age"-like (Illusion of Time, Secret of Mana, Chrono trigger, etc.).
For now that's just a small blob of code in which one can try to see how far one can go with such cutting edge technics.
###For tech savvy


##SH Scripts bundled
###make.sh
As expected, the `make.sh` script build the project from source and put the files in the right places.
###run.sh
Just launch the server. Listening at http://localhost:3000 .
###debug.sh
More interesting, start a [Debug session] [Debug session] with a almighty firebug-like tool, able to set breakpoints directly in the application (OMG I'm in love with node-inspector !) .
